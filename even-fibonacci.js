// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

// var = Identify last term
// var = Use to identify second to last term
// loop sequence
// < 4000000
// filter even values
// find sum



var one = 1;
var two = 2;
var three = 3;



var fibby = one + two;
	console.log(fibby);
var five = fibby + two;
	console.log(five);
